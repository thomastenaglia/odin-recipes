    <p>Leftover Skillet Turkey Pasta,  an easy Pasta recipe, just add some of your favourite veggies such as mushrooms, tomatoes and peppers add some leftover cut up chicken or turkey and Dinner is Served. </p>
    <p>As I plan my Christmas lunch menu, a typical Italian Christmas, Lasagna, Roast Potatoes, Roast Lamb, Roast Pork or Stuffed Flank Steak. I remember last Christmas when we were all together under the same roof in Toronto. Laughing, eating, drinking wine and telling stories.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot add the olive oil, ground beef, chopped carrots, celery, onion, garlic and salt, saut√© for approximately 10 minutes or until meat has started to brown, then add the tomato pure, water and spices, cook on medium heat until thickened (quite thick), approximately 30-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish measuring 10x10x2 (25x25x5 cm) spread 2-3 spoonfuls of meat sauce on the bottom of the pan, add a layer of lasagna noodles, then continue to layer in the following order, the meat sauce, white sauce, chopped mozzarella and parmesan cheese, continue making 3-4 layers, the last layer should be without the white sauce, so remember to divide the ingredients by 3 or 4, depending on how many layers you wish to make.</li>
